# Dispensary-Management-System

Project Description: Dispensary Shop Management System
The Dispensary Shop Management System is a comprehensive application developed using core C# language, adhering strictly to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system is designed to streamline and automate the operations of a dispensary, ensuring efficient management of inventory, sales, and customer interactions.

# Technologies Used:

Core C#: The application is built using core C# language, known for its powerful features and support for OOP.
OOP Concepts: The project utilizes core OOP concepts, including:
Properties: Used to encapsulate data and provide a controlled way of accessing and modifying the attributes of classes.
Arrays: Employed to store collections of related data, such as lists of products, users, and sales records.
Encapsulation: Ensures that the internal state of objects is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed or modified through well-defined interfaces.
Inheritance: Allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
Polymorphism: Enables methods to perform different tasks based on the context in which they are called, enhancing flexibility and reusability.
Abstraction: Focuses on exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details, simplifying the system's usage and maintenance.
Key Roles and Features:

#User:

Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to the system securely.
Product Browsing: Users can browse available products, view details, and check availability.
Purchase History: Users can view their past purchases and track order statuses.

# Manager:

Inventory Management: Managers can add, update, and delete product information, ensuring accurate inventory records.
Sales Reports: Generate detailed sales reports to monitor performance and make informed decisions.
User Management: Oversee user registrations, manage user roles, and handle permissions.
Supplier Coordination: Maintain records of suppliers and manage orders and deliveries.

# Seller:

Sales Processing: Process sales transactions efficiently, including adding items to the cart, applying discounts, and processing payments.
Customer Interaction: Assist customers with product inquiries, recommendations, and general support.
Stock Monitoring: Keep track of stock levels in real-time and alert managers when stock is low.
The Dispensary Shop Management System employs the core principles of OOP, leveraging properties, arrays, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create a modular, efficient, and maintainable application. This system not only improves the overall management of dispensary operations but also enhances the user experience for customers, managers, and sellers alike.
